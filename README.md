Welcome to Antikythera! Originated from ___________________ 

## Introduction Page 
Upon entering the game, you will encounter the introduction page. This page will contain all instructions and rules necessary for understanding the game. 

## The game 
Antikythera is based off of various versions of already established internet games, such as color switch, where the objective of the game is to avoid all enemies for as long as possible. There is a pre-determined circle track that the player is allowed to move around at a pre-set constant pace. The player is allowed to switch between the outer and inner edge of the circle by pressing the space bar to avoid enemies. 

## Enemies
Throughout the game, the player will encounter enemies of various types. There are three types of enemies so far. One type is stationary and allowed to be spawned anywhere on the circle, additionally with a 50%-50% chance of spawning on either the outer and inner edge. The second type of enemy moves around the circle, just like the player, but in the opposite orientation. The third type of enemy moves in a diagonal, spawning from one corner at the bottom of the screen, and moves to the opposite corner at the top of the screen.
