—————————————————————————————————————————
Queenie:
1. Created and wrote the Enemy class file
2. After a heated argument, decided to go alone with Terry’s idea of using (rcos(theta), rsin(theta)) polar coordinates for the movement of one type of enemy and the player instead of the fraction equation.
3. Figured out how to translate images and objects created to the center of the screen
4. Added a moving enemy

Terry:
1. Created and wrote the Character
2. Wrote subclass Player
3. Decided with Queenie to use polar coordinates of (rcos(theta), rsin(theta)) to represent movements of one type of enemy and the player

Fabiola:
1. Linked submodule
2. Worked in class to flesh out and clarify the proposal


2017-05-24
—————————————————————————————————————————
Terry:
1. Robustified Queenie’s code of placing a stationary enemy
2. Allowed for the stationary enemy to be positioned anywhere on/in the circle

Queenie:
1. Added a stationary enemy that has a 50% chance of being spawned on the outer edge of the circle, and 50% chance of being spawned on the inner edge.
2. Originally created the code that only allowed the enemy to be stationed at one of the 0, 90, 180, and 270 positions.

—————————————————————————————————————————
Terry:
1. Added player and enemy detection —- but works only for the stationary enemies so far.
2. Altered the direction of the moving enemy so that it circles the opposite direction of the Player’s movement.

Queenie:
1. Added a new type of enemy that moves diagonally from one corner of the screen to the other.


2017-05-25
—————————————————————————————————————————
Terry:
1. Added PriorityQueue class. Copied from hw and then modified
2. Added detection for ALL enemies
3. Added methods isDead(), drawEnemy(), and addEnemy() 

Queenie:
1. Added implementation for a LLStack by using the Stack interface and the code that we derived from classwork and homework.
2. Created Upgrades class that will store various features of upgrade items such as cost, item name, duration of item, and description of item.
3. Created 2 different types of upgrades: slow-down and double-points. Slow-down will slow down the frame rate of all characters, thus slowing down movement of all players, for a duration of 10 seconds. Doubling the points will double the amount of a points per second that a player can receive for a duration of 10 seconds.
4. Implemented a compareTo method for comparing the priorities of enemies.
